## Installing Instructions

Adding flutter widgets to any flutter app is just one command away

```bash
dart pub add 'flutter_widgets:{"git":"https://github.com/sostronk/flutter-widgets.git"}'
```


## Usage

```dart
// FlexibleText is a Flutter widget that allows you to seamlessly mix and match rich text segments and widgets within a single text block.
// Customize your text with different styles and gestures, and insert inline widgets using simple placeholders. This powerful and flexible
// solution makes it easy to create dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing text in your Flutter applications.
FlexibleText(
  text: 'Hello :World:~1~~star~',
  style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
  richStyles: [TextStyle(color: Colors.red)],
  textRecognizers: [TapGestureRecognizer()..onTap = () { print('World tapped'); }],
  namedWidgets: {'star': Icon(Icons.star)},
  widgets: [Icon(Icons.star)],
);

```dart
// Skewed TabBar allows you to create a tab bar with skews. This can be an alternative different from the usual tab bar.
class SkewedTabScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const SkewedTabScreen({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final List<Widget> tabs =
        List.generate(3, (index) => Text('Tab ${index + 1}'));
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Skewed Tab Bar'),
      ),
      body: SkewedTabBar(
        tabs: tabs,
        views: tabs
            .map(
              (e) => Container(
                color: Colors.greenAccent,
                alignment: Alignment.center,
                child: e,
              ),
            )
            .toList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

```dart
AnimatedReorderList(
        key: const ValueKey('animatedReorderList'),
        keyingFunction: (item) => item.key!,
        items: users,
        duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 600),
        itemBuilder: (context, element) => Container(
          key: element.key,
          margin: const EdgeInsetsDirectional.symmetric(
            horizontal: 10,
            vertical: 5,
          ),
          height: 35,
          color: Colors.greenAccent,
          alignment: Alignment.center,
          child: element,
        ),
      )
```
When the order of list items updates, AnimatedReorderList will auto animate the reorder

```dart
  final tmpListp = List<Widget>.from(users);

        debugPrint('users>> befrroe:\n$users');

        final tmp = tmpListp[1];
        tmpListp[1] = tmpListp[5];
        tmpListp[5] = tmp;

        setState(() {
          users = List<Widget>.from(tmpListp);
          debugPrint('\nusers>> after:\n$users');
        });
```
